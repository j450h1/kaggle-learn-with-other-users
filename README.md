In this competition you’ll predict what types of trees there are in an area based on various geographic features.  The competition datasets comes from a study conducted in four wilderness areas within the beautiful Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. These areas represent forests with very little human disturbances – the existing forest cover types there are more a result of ecological processes rather than forest management practices.  The data is in raw form and contains categorical data such as wilderness areas and soil type.
